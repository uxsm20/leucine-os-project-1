# Frontend Setup and Configuration

## Recent Changes and Corrections

### Build Configuration
- Added Vite configuration (`vite.config.js`)
- Set up PostCSS (`postcss.config.js`)
- Configured TailwindCSS (`tailwind.config.js`)
- Added main CSS file with Tailwind directives

### Project Structure Correction
Initially, we incorrectly moved the landing page to `src/index.html`. This needs to be corrected as follows:

#### Correct Structure:
```
frontend/src/
├── index.html           # Application shell (needs to be created)
├── main.js             # Main application entry (needs to be created)
├── pages/
│   └── landing/        # Landing page component
│       └── index.html  # Landing page content
├── components/         # Reusable components
├── router/            # Route definitions (needs to be created)
└── styles/
    └── main.css       # Global styles with Tailwind
```

### Next Steps
1. Create application shell (`index.html`)
2. Set up proper routing system
3. Move landing page content to its component
4. Create main application entry point

### Development Environment
- Package.json updated with ES modules support
- Added necessary development dependencies:
  - Vite for build system
  - TailwindCSS for styling
  - PostCSS for CSS processing
  - Autoprefixer for browser compatibility

### Build System Configuration
The Vite configuration needs to be updated to:
- Support proper routing
- Handle static assets correctly
- Enable development server features

## Corrective Actions Needed
1. Revert the landing page move:
   ```bash
   mv frontend/src/index.html frontend/src/pages/landing/index.html
   ```
2. Create proper application shell
3. Implement routing system
4. Update build configuration for multi-page support

## Best Practices
- Keep pages in their respective directories under `/pages`
- Implement proper routing for navigation
- Use application shell pattern for consistent layout
- Maintain separation of concerns in component structure
